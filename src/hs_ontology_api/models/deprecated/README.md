# Deprecated model classes

October 2025
The model classes in this folder integrate with 
Cypher queries that are based on the
OpenAPI framework. 

As part of a long term project, endpoints of the 
the hs-ontology-api are being refactored to return
JSON directly. Cyphers and model classes related to the
OpenAPI framework will be deprecated and then removed
completely.
