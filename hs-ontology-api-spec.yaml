  title: HuBMAP/SenNet Ontology API (hs-ontology-api)
  description: The HuBMAP/SenNet Ontology API contains endpoints for querying a [UBKG](https://ubkg.docs.xconsortia.org/) instance with content from the [HuBMAP/SenNet context](https://ubkg.docs.xconsortia.org/contexts/#hubmapsennet-context). The hs-ontology-api imports the [ubkg-api](https://smart-api.info/ui/96e5b5c0b0efeef5b93ea98ac2794837), which encapsulates both basic connectivity to a UBKG instance and generic endpoint code. To prevent exceeding service timeouts or payload limits, some endpoints are throttled in both execution time and in the size of its response payload--e.g., to a maximum execution time of 29 seconds and a maximum payload of 9.9 MB.
